# Stories-Hub

StoryHub is a web application which allows user to create and share stories.

**Tech used:** Nodejs, MongoDB, Expressjs, Passportjs,HTML, CSS, CKEditor

I decided to use this tech stack as it enabled me to improve my understanding of basic CRUD Operations and the implementation of RESTFUL APIs. It also gave me the chance to understand the importance of organizing code using MVC architecture

## Possible Additions in the Future

- Enabling users to like stories that they find intriguing
- Expand local authentication via passportjs to users of the application, not just demo users.
- Add more rich features to text editor such as images, and other forms of text formatting.

## Lessons Learned:

Before jumping straight to coding, taking the time to properly design models and research on possible use cases would have saved me a good chunk of time, in terms of figuring out how to render certain user/application data to the view.
