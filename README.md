# StoryHub

StoryHub is a web application which allows user to create and share stories.

**Link to project:** https://story-hub-app.herokuapp.com/

<!-- ![alt tag](http://placecorgi.com/1200/650) -->

**Tech used:** Nodejs, MongoDB, Expressjs, Passportjs,HTML, CSS, CKEditor

I decided to use this tech stack as it enabled me to improve my understanding of basic CRUD Operations and the implementation of RESTful APIs. It also gave me the chance to understand the importance of organizing code using MVC architecture

## Possible Additions in the Future

- Enabling users to like stories that they find intriguing
- Expand local authentication via passportjs to potential users of the application, not just demo users.
- Add more rich features to text editor such as image uploading, and other forms of text formatting.

## Lessons Learned

In Hindsight, before jumping straight into the coding aspect, taking the time to properly plan and design models and research on possible use cases would have saved me a good chunk of time during development.
