**Tech used:** Nodejs, MongoDB, Expressjs, Passportjs,HTML, CSS, CKEditor

I decided to use this tech stack as it enabled me to improve my understanding of basic CRUD Operations and the implementation of RESTful APIs. It also gave me the chance to understand the importance of organizing code using MVC architecture

## Possible Additions in the Future

- Enabling users to like stories that they find intriguing
- Expand local authentication via passportjs to potential users of the application, not just demo users.
- Add more rich features to text editor such as image uploading, and other forms of text formatting.

## Lessons Learned

<<<<<<< HEAD
Before jumping straight to coding, taking the time to properly design models and research on possible use cases would have saved me a good chunk of time, in terms of figuring out how to render certain user/application data to the view.

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.

## Installation

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
  Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PROJECT_TITLE
    $ cd PROJECT_TITLE
    $ npm install

## Running the project for development

    $ npm run dev

## Simple build for production

    $ npm start

In Hindsight, before jumping straight into the coding aspect, taking the time to properly plan and design models and research on possible use cases would have saved me a good chunk of time during development.
